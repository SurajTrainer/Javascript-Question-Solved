// try to add a new key to the const object in problem 3 . were you able to do it?

const obj ={
    number :  34
}
console.log(obj);
obj.number = 23; 
console.log(obj);

obj.city = 'kerela'

console.log(obj);

// with chatgpt..

// Creating a const object
const myObject = {
    myProperty: "Hello"
  };
  
  // Displaying the original object
//   console.log(myObject);
  
  // Adding a new key to the object
  myObject.newKey = 42;
  
  // Displaying the modified object
//   console.log(myObject);



// In this example, a new key newKey is added to the myObject object after it has been declared as a const. This operation is allowed, and the const restriction only applies to reassigning the variable itself, not modifying the properties or adding new ones to the object.
